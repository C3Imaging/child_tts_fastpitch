# child_tts_fastpitch
Fastpitch text-to-speech (TTS) model for generating high-quality synthetic child speech. This study uses the transfer learning training pipeline. The approach involved finetuning a multi-speaker TTS model to work with child speech. We use the publicly available MyST dataset (55 hours) for our finetuning experiments.
